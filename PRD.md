# User-Selected Delivery Time Window PRD

## Background

Currently, our delivery system automatically assigns delivery time slots to customers when they place orders. Users have no ability to choose when their orders will be delivered.

## Goal

Improve customer satisfaction by allowing users to optionally select their preferred delivery time window during the order placement process.

---

## Requirements

### User Selection of Delivery Slots

* Users should be able to select a preferred delivery time slot when placing an order
* Selection must be optional - users can still place orders without choosing a time slot
* If no slot is selected, system should continue using the current automatic assignment logic

### Slot Availability

* System must check if the selected slot has available capacity 
* Users should not be able to select slots that are already at maximum capacity
* We need to decide the behavior when a user selects a full slot:
  * Either: Return an informative error message to the user
  * Or: Silently fall back to our automatic assignment (implementation team to recommend)

### Order Information

* Orders must store information about the assigned delivery time slot
* Order history and details should display the selected/assigned time slot

---

## Business Constraints

* This feature must be backward compatible - existing orders and processes should continue to work
* The delivery capacity planning must remain accurate - slots should not be overbooked
* We should maintain our current SLAs for delivery reliability

## Future Considerations

* In the future, we may want to support:
  * Admin-reserved slots for VIP customers
  * Multi-slot delivery for larger orders
* Please consider how your implementation might accommodate these future requirements

## ⚠️ Cross-Department Impacts

### Risk Management

* The fraud detection team has noted that certain delivery time patterns (e.g., late-night weekend deliveries) may correlate with higher fraud risk
* We need to ensure risk assessment still functions correctly with user-selected slots

### Operations Dashboard

* The operations team relies on an admin dashboard that shows slot availability
* Any changes to slot allocation must be correctly reflected in their view

### Customer Communications

* Order confirmation messages sent to customers should include their selected delivery time
* If we fall back to an automatically assigned slot, the communication should clearly indicate this

### Data Validation

* All user input for slot selection must be properly validated to ensure system integrity
